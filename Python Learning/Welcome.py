# This line is a comment, python ignores comment
# Comment are only for humans to understand the code
#print is a default function

#print("Hello , Python !!")
#print("Welcome to day1 ")

#Variables
# A variable is a box where we can store the information

#name = "Zulfikhar"
#city = "Para"

#print("My name is " , name)
#print("I am from " , city)

# No need to declare variable type, Python decides the data type automatically
# Example in Java: String name = "Zulfikhar" or int salary = 123456

# input will help to get the data dynamically
#Input will return Text not number
name = input("What is your name? ")
city = input("What is your city? ")

##you can manipulate strings but if you want to get other datatypes you have to cast

print("Hey : " , name)
print("Nice to know you are from : ", city)
