Parent clues in dinosaur eggs
The Qianshan eggs are nearly spherical and lack clear embryonic remains, making it impossible for scientists to identify the parents with any certainty.

Shell shape, size, and microscopic structure point toward a plant-eating ornithopod. This is a two-legged runner with a broad, duck-like snout.

These dinosaurs thrived from the Late Jurassic epoch into the Late Cretaceous, and often reached around 20 to 30 feet (6 to 9 meters) from snout to tail.

They vanished with other large, non-bird dinosaurs when a 6-mile-wide (9.5-kilometer-wide) asteroid slammed into the Yucatan region, about 66 million years ago.

Despite not being able to identify the parents to species level, the scientists state that the dinosaur eggs expand the record of ornithopod reproduction in southern China.

It adds a new data point in understanding how these plant eaters laid and protected their clutches.
